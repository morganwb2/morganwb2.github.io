But, the exception to this definition is that changes to the code signature portion of the app's executable binary (Payload/daibutsu.app/daibutsu) do not constitute "modified" as defined by Creative Commons. Only modifications to the code signature of the app's executable binary (Payload/daibutsu.app/daibutsu) are defined as modifications that satisfy the "NoDerivatives" constraint. This means that a sideloading service can replace the signature of the app's executable binary (Payload/daibutsu.app/daibutsu) with its own valid signature and distribute it.</p>
